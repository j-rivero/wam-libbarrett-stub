Interface for Barrett Arm and Hand and plain-socket interface

Directories:
waminterface: functions that use Barrett's btclient code and talk to the Barrett hand via serial port
socketwamif: a simple socket interface to run the arm/hand from another computer, or just without having to link to Barrett's code (which causes all kinds of problems)
testprograms: sample code
log: logging library
lib: where the waminterface library is compiled to
